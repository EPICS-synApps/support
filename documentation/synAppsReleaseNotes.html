<h2>Module release notes</h2>
<hr>
<h2>autosave</h2>
<h3>4.2.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added date/time to error messages printed to the console.
<li>If asVerify is directed to create a restore file, it now writes a trial
restore file first, and overwrites the real restore file only if more than half
of the PV's were actually connected. 
</ul>

<h3>4.2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added asVerify, a client-side tool to compare autosave .sav files
with current PV values.  Also can write a .sav file useable for restoring
values.
</ul>

<h3>4.1.3</h3>
<ul>
<li>Debug macros made more compliant with various compilers.
<li>save_restore made less sensitive to errors.  Previously, any file
write that set errno would abort the save, but this was just stupid,
and caused way more problems than it solved.

<li>Status PV's were restricted to STRING_LEN (30) characters, instead
of PV_NAME_LEN (61).
<li>Increased stack size to epicsThreadStackBig.
<li>Don't treat unsupported fsync() as an error.
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>calc</h2>
<h3>2.6.3</h3>
<ul>
<li>array calcs reworked to allocate arrays only as needed.
<br>aCalcPerform
allocates no stack space until it is called.  Then, it allocates 20
arrays of length aCalcArraySize (a volatile int, settable from the shell)
or the arraySize argument specified by the first caller, whichever is
larger.
<br>aCalcoutRecord allocates an NELEM-size array for each variable AA-LL,
when that variable is first read from or written to.
</ul>

<h3>2.6.2</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Added the following functions for the aCalcout record
<dl>
<dt>DERIV <dd>take derivative (with respect to element number)
<dt>FITPOLY <dd>fit to 2nd order polynomial
<dt>FITMPOLY <dd>masked fit to 2nd order polynomial
<dt>NSMOO <dd>apply smoothing operator a specified number of times
</dl>
<li>reworked medm displays that describe calc expressions
<li>reworked medm displays for aCalcout record
<li>fixed swaitRecord docs
</ul>

<h3>2.6.1</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>sCalcout and aCalcout records were not calling device support's
init_record() routine
<li><p>Added FWHM function to array calc support.
</ul>

<h3>2.6</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Added array calc support.  This generalizes EPICS standard calc support
in much the same way that the string calc support did, but with arrays
instead of strings.

<li><p>Added a python program to test string-calc software.

<li><p>Interp support uses different genSub-record fields, and has acquired a mode switch
and a success indicator.  See calc/documentation/interp.README.

<li><p>sCalcout record has two new functions:
<ul>
<li>TR_ESC() translates escape sequences into the characters they represent
<li>ESC()    translates selected unprintable characters into escape sequences.
</ul>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>camac</h2>
<h3>2.4</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Changed drvMotorE500.cc to use generic epicsThread priority</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>ccd</h2>
<h3>1.6</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added support for WIN32.</li>
  <li>Removed variable argument macros for debugging in SNL code.</li>
  <li>Minor changes in MAR code.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>dac128V</h2>
<ul>
<li>No changes.
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>dxp</h2>
<h3>2.4</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added support for detector "groups" in the dxp and mca record drivers.  This is used to turn on 
      and off acquisition on all detectors as efficiently as possible.  Modifed dxpMED.db and dxpMED.st to
      take advantage of this new capability.
  <li>Added support for the new xMAP PXI modules.  This support runs on the cygwin-x86 architecture.
  <li>Enhancements to dxpRecord:
  <ul>
     <li>Made baseline filter length (BASE_LEN) be a menu rather than a number.
     <li>Added readback for baseline filter length (BASE_LEN_RBV)
     <li>Added the baseline cut enable (BASE_CUT_ENBL) and readback (BASE_CUT_ENBL_RBV) fields.
     <li>Implemented the pre-amp gain (PGAIN) and readback (PGAIN_RBV) fields.
     <li>Added time/point for the baseline history (BHIST_TIME).  This is currently only implemented on the xMAP.
     <li>Removed BASETHRADJ since xMAP does not support it, and it's available as low-level parameter.
  </ul>
  <li>Added code to support ADC trace and baseline history to dxpMED.st for multi-element detectors.
  <li>Fixes and enhancements for 40MHz version of Saturn.
  <li>Added support for native Windows build, in addition to Cygwin.
  <li>This version does NOT support the DXP4C2X because that support from XIA lags behind the Saturn and xMAP in terms
      of what acquisition parameters it supports.  The DXP4C2X will be supported in the next release.
  <li>List of things to be added/fixed in next release:
  <ul>
    <li>Implement missing functions on DXP-2X so it will work again.
    <li>Get algorithm for baseline threshold in energy units, implement on Saturn and DXP-2X.
    <li>Implement ROI mapping mode on Saturn and DXP-2X.
    <li>Implement MCA mapping mode on xMAP.
    <li>Implement fast SCA acquisition on all models.
    <li>Add DXP record fields for polarity, reset interval, and RC time constant.
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>2.3</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added several readback fields to dxpRecord (BASETHRESH_RBV, etc.)
  <li>Use value of RUNTASKS from save/restore, so that auto baseline threshold adjust and other
      bits are restored.
  <li>Fixed bugs in setting SCAs from MCA ROIs which were causing error messages.
  <li>Fixed init_record in dxpRecord so that BASETHRESH from save/restore is set correctly
      if automatic baseline threshold adjust is disabled.
  <li>Fixed definition of bit 0 in RUNTASKS in dxp2x_rc.db and dxp2x_reset.db.  
      This bug was causing baseline histogramming to stop if any other bits were
      modified in RUNTASKS.
  <li>Added 40MHz firmware files for the Saturn.
  <li>Fixed bug that was causing bit 0 of RUNTASKS to be reset, turning off baseline histogramming
      whenever RUNTASKS was modified.
  <li>Added new ECAL field.  ADC_RULE is now at energy=ECAL, not at energy=EMAX/2.
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>ip</h2>
<h3>2.7</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added support for Newport LAE500 autocollimator
<li>Added support for additional thermocouple types for Keithley 2700 multimeter
<li>Databases using asyn serial support no longer set input/output terminator.
This must be done in asyn-record configuration.
<li>HeidVRZ460_encoder.db converted to use asyn
<li>Keithley2kDMM_mf.db  -- Modified by Arun 08-Feb-2006 to include R-type thermocouple
<li>Keithley2kDMM_mf20_settings.req -- new file
<li>Keithley2kDMM_mf_channelN_settings.req now just includes calcout_settings.req
<li>pzt3.db, pzt_3id.db -- BitBus-based databases deleted.
<li>Keithley2kDMM.st -- Added support for additional thermocouple types for 2700
<li>devAiHeidND261.c -- converted to use asyn
<li>devXxEurotherm.c -- converted to use asyn
</ul>


<hr>
<h2>ip330</h2>
<h3>2.4</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Minor bug fix in driver.</li>
</ul>


<hr>
<h2>ipUnidig</h2>
<h3>2.4</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Ron Sluiter fixed a bug in initIpUnidig() of drvIpUnidig.c.
       The BSP was not enabling interrupts for whatever level
       the IP carrier was configured for unless some other
       IRQ handler, with the same IRQ level, had already
       enabled interrupts.</li>
  <li>Kurt Goetze added new medm adl files: IpUnidig_all.adl, IpUnidig_help.adl,
      IpUnidig_top.adl </li>
</ul>

<h2>mca</h2>
<h3>6.8</h3>
<ul>
<li> Minor changes to drvFastSweep and drvIcbAsyn</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h3>6.7</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed timing bug in communication between record and device support.
      In previous releases device support was setting the .ACQG field to 0 (Done)
      before the final read of the device was complete.  This meant that channel access
      clients that were doing cagets() of .ACQG to see when acquisition was complete
      and then reading data immediately could get incorrect data.  Note that this problem did not
      occur if clients were using monitors (callbacks), because the record did not
      call dbPostEvents until the final read of data from the device was complete.
      <p>
      The fix to this problem required re-writing the interface between the record and
      device support so that device support does not directly modify the .ACQG field.
      Rather it now passes a structure with status information which the record uses
      to modify the record fields, and it does not set the .ACQG field until the record contains
      the latest data.
      <p>
      The record support, asyn device support (for all devices except Struck), and the Struck (SIS) 
      device support were all modified.
  <li>mcaRecord
    <ul>
      <li>Converted all DBF_FLOAT record fields to DBF_DOUBLE.
      <li>Added the PSTATUS (private) field for status buffer.
      <li>Removed the ACQP, DWLP, ERTP, ELTP and ACTP (private) fields which are
          no longer needed because PSTATUS field replaces them.
    </ul>
   <li>Removed macro definitions with variable arguments (e.q. Debug) for portability.
</ul>

<h3>6.6</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added mcaApp/RontecSrc directory with support for the Rontec XFlash MCA.   
      This works with any serial port with asyn support.
  <li>Added support for Canberra AIM on Windows IOCs (using Cygwin).
  <li>Fixed a bug in mcaRecord.  If a channel access put should have caused the record
      to process again because it was busy (.RPRO field=1) it was not processing again
      because the record only calls recGblFwdLink when acquisition completes.  Work around
      problem by checking RPRO at end of record processing and repeating processing loop
      if RPRO=1 and acquisition is not complete.
  <li>Fixed occasional timing problem with Canberra AIM on Linux not receiving first
      inquiry response.
  <li>Fixed problems with the iocLinux and iocVxWorks example IOCs.
  <li>Added iocRontec example IOC.
  <li>Added iocCygwin example IOC for Canberra on Cygwin.
  <li>Added mcaApp/op/adl/mcaTest.adl medm screen for testing the example IOCs.
  <li>Improved the documentation in mcaDoc.html and mcaRecord.html.
  <li>Added the acquiring (.ACQG) field to 16element_time.adl.
  <li>Things planned for future release:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Add a calibrated X axis PV, so one can plot spectra versus energy in medm
      <li>
        Add ROI low and high PVs in calibrated units, so that users can define ROIs
        in calibrated unit (e.g. energy), and copy ROIs from one MCA to another in
        these calibrated units.
      <li>
        Add medm screen shots to the mcaDoc, mcaCanberra, and mcaStruck html files.
    </ul>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>motor</h2>
  <H3>5.9</H3>

<ul>
<li>Soft Motor allocation limit<br>
  Peter Denison (Diamond Light Source) enhanced the Soft Channel device support by 
  eliminating the 50 soft motor limit and replacing it with an unlimited linked list.
<li>All motors done/stop/moving utility<br>
  Kevin Peterson's (UNI-CAT) motorUtil task was added to the motor record 
  distribution. The motorUtil task monitors and maintains 3 PV's; $(P)alldone, $(P)allstop, 
  $(P)moving. motorUtil is a replacement for the all_com_##.db distributed with 
  the STD support module.  See the motorUtil.db file for details.
<li>Asyn Motor</br>
  Peter Denison (Diamond), Nick Rees (Diamond) and Mark Rivers (APS) have added a 
  new motor record device support architecture based on ASYN; called "asyn motor" 
  support.  The asyn motor support <I>is an attempt to define a clean, extensible 
  API for motor controller drivers to support</I>.  This is a preliminary release 
  of work in progress.  Do not use <I>asynMotor</I> device support at this time, except 
  for development and testing purposes only.

<li>New Focus 8750 Network Controller<br>
  Joe Sullivan added support for the New Focus Model 8750 Network Controller.

<li>Physik Instrumente (PI) E-662 piezo controller<br>
  Joe Sullivan added support for the Physik Instrumente (PI) GmbH & Co. Model E-662 
  piezo controller.

<li>Newport XPS-C8 asyn motor support<br>
  Mark Rivers added asyn motor support for the Newport XPS-C8 motor controller. 
  This is a preliminary release of work in progress. However, it has fewer 
  problems than the previous XPS support, so we recommend using the new asyn 
  support for the XPS, with the understanding that it is still under development.

<li>Trajectory Scanning<br>
  Mark Rivers added the Trajectory Scanning software for both the Newport MM4005 
  and XPS-C8 motor controllers to the motor record distribution.

<li>OMS PC68 and PC78 support<br>
  Brian Tieman and Ron Sluiter added support for the standalone, RS-232 versions 
  of the OMS PC68 and PC78 model controllers.  The same device driver (OMS PC68/78) 
  supports both models.
</ul>

<H3>5.8</H3>
<ul>
<li>Faulhaber MCDC2805<br>
  Mark Rivers added support for the Faulhaber MCDC2805 servo controller.
<li>Parker Hannifin, Compumotor Division, 6K Series<br>
  Joe Sullivan added support for Parker Hannifin, Compumotor Division, 6K Series 
  controllers.
</ul>

<h3>5.7</h3>
<ul>
<li>Initial Position<br>
  With this release, if the absolute values of both the save/restore's target 
  position and the controller's commanded position are greater than the re-try 
  deadband (RDBD) at boot-up, then DVAL will be initialized from the controller's 
  value.  In other words, if the absolute value of the controller's commanded 
  position is greater than the re-try deadband at boot-up, than the controller's 
  position takes precedence over the save/restore value.
<li>Physik Instrumente (PI) C-630<br>
  Kurt Goetze added support for the Physik Instrumente (PI) model C-630 motion 
  controller.
<li>Physik Instrumente (PI) C-848<br>
  Support added for the Physik Instrumente (PI) C-848 motor controller.
</ul>

<h2>quadEM</h2>
<h3>2.3</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed driver so that configuration routines can be called from iocsh.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>sscan</h2>
<h>2.5.3</h3>

<ul>
<li>Added sscanApp/op/python directory, with the following programs:
<dl>
<dt>addMDA.py<dd>Front end for adding MDA files, uses readMDA, opMDA, and writeMDA
from mda.py
<dt>mda.py<dd>Python API for MDA files.  Supports reading, writing, and arithmetic
operations for up to 4-dimensional MDA files
<dt>mdaAsc.py<dd>Uses mda.py to render a 1-dimensional MDA file as ascii text.
<dt>opMDA.py<dd>Front end for operating on MDA files, uses readMDA, opMDA, and writeMDA
from mda.py
</dl>

<li>Added Dohn Arms' 'mdautils' software in the sscanApp/src
directory.  This software can convert an MDA file to ascii, print info
about an MDA file, and read an MDA file into C data structures.

<li>Fixed a race condition in the sscan record that was responsible for hanging scans
at the last point (and maybe other things as well).

<li> the sscan record no longer renews PV links when a scan starts if the new scan
follows the previous scan by less than sscanRecordLookupTime.

<li>If retrace or after-scan fails because recDynLinkPutCallback returns an error, skip
the action rather than hang.

<li>If the sscan record attempts to connect to a PV while an earlier connection attempt
is still in progress, it now waits and retries.

<li>recDynLinkQsize is now exported for use by the ioc shell.

<li>recDynLink used to crash if one of its callback functions received an
event_handler_args structure with a status element whose value was not ==
ECA_NORMAL.  Now it declines to process the event or to pass it on to the client.

<li>saveData used to check directory permissions by attempting to create a file
whose name was illegal (contained ':') on some operating systems.
</ul>

<h3>2.5.2</h3>

<ul>
<li>sscanRecord checks parameters more closely, allows before-scan and after-scan
links to write to selected PV's of their own sscan record.

<li>New after-scan action: Move to center of mass of peak (this choice has
problems with multiple positioners, since they won't, in general, have the
same peak position).

<li>In previous versions, recDynLink would deadlock if asked to clear the link
to a PV while an action for that PV was still on queue.  This is fixed.

<li>saveData zeros unused points in its XDR buffer, because XDR doesn't manage
this well.
