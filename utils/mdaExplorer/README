mdaExplorer is a GUI program, based on wxPython and matplotlib, for exploring
MDA files.  The MDA file format is described in the synApps sscan module, and
is written by that module's saveData program.

mdaExplorer.py - This is the main program.

mdaTree.py     - Routines to read an MDA file and collect information into a
                 tree (an instance of wx.TreeCtrl)

mda_f.py       - A faster version of mda.py, which uses f_xdrlib.py to read
                 arrays in big chunks, rather than element by element.

f_xdrlib.py    - A modified copy of xdrlib.py, software from Python 2.5 which
                 uses the Python struct module to convert data from an XDR
				 file to native Python variables

InstallSteps*.txt - The procedure I went through to install Python 2.5 and all
                    the python-related stuff needed to run mdaExplorer.

Menus
File
	Survey MDA files
	Open MDA file
	Save as ASCII file
	Show file as tree

Options
	Read 3D Data
		If this item is not checked, only 1D and 2D data will be read from the
		data file.

	AutoUpdatePlots
		Update plots whenever a relevant plot setting changes.  If the "MDA
		Survey" window (See File/Survey MDA files) is open and displays the
		directory containing the currently plotted data file, plots will be
		updated when the file is updated.

	1D plots
		lines
		points
		with axes
		with labels
		log Y axis
		with shared axes
			All plots will use the same X and Y axes.  When zooming into one
			plot, all plots will zoom to the same X/Y range.
	2D plots
		with axes
		with labels
		with colorbar
		with shared axes
			All plots will use the same X and Y axes.  When zooming into one
			plot, all plots will zoom to the same X/Y range.
		auto aspect
			Make images square.
