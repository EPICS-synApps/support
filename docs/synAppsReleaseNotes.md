synApps 6.1 Release Notes
=========================

StreamDevice is now included directly from the PSI repository, it is no longer a wrapper directory around PSI code.

Modules can now install their autosave req files to the top-level db folder by putting REQ += file.req in a makefile

Four new build options at top level; all\_adl, all\_ui, all\_opi, and all\_edl. Will search all support modules for files of the specified type and install them to a top level all\_\* folder.

Makefile also updated to use each module's RELEASE file to build dependencies. This means that adding a new module to an existing synApps directory is now as easy as dropping the module in and specifying it's name in the makefile's MODULE\_LIST.

copyScreens.pl:
- replaces copyAdl, copyUi, and copyOpi
- top level synapps makefile now has a set of targets to replicate those scripts
- use 'make all\_adl', 'make all\_ui', or 'make all\_opi', respectively

- Version changes from R6-0 to R6-1

synApps 6.0 Release Notes
=========================

This version of synApps is specifically targeted against epics base 3.15. While the modules will still build against earlier versions of base, the ioc shell scripts provided with the modules may rely on 3.15-specific support.

Modules now can contain an iocsh folder which provide ioc shell scripts to individually load a device onto an IOC. These are designed for use with the iocshLoad function in base and the scripts have comments describing the macros that should be set to use them.

changePrefix:
- Rewritten in perl to allow cross-platform usage
- Updated for synApps 6-0 reorganization of xxx

- Version changes from R5-8 to R6-0

synApps 5.8 Release Notes
=========================

This version of synApps is compatible with both base 3.14.12 and 3.15.1. In the default build, none of the modules take advantage of features in 3.15 that are not backward compatible with 3.14. Beginning with synApps 6.0, modules will no longer be required to work with base 3.14.

copyUi.py - Copy all .ui and .qss to specified directory  
addTag.py - For a module that already has a module tag, tag that same revision with another tag.  
adlDir2uiDir - Rewritten to change only .ui files in ui directory  
adl2uiAll - translate all .adl files in synApps to .ui  
changePrefix:  
- Better handle testing for existence of files
- Made changePrefix smarter about changing prefix in src/Makefile
- Modified changePrefix to handle xxx.sh, as well as new versions of run and in-screen.sh
snapDb.py - Maintain default paths for medm displays, databases, and displayinfo files; specify display files for aSub, compress, mbbo, mca, scaler, sub, and vme record types.  

- Version changes from R5-7 to R5-8

Note that synApps contains only ADCore and ADBinaries, because those modules require no vendor-supplied support. Other modules are available from [areaDetector on github](https://github.com/areaDetector/areaDetector)  The copy in the synApps tar file has been modified:   - Makefile: "DIRS := $(DIRS) ADBinaries" -&gt; "DIRS := $(DIRS) $(ADBINARIES)", and so on - RELEASE files have all been changed to support synApps "make release" - NDPluginSupport.dbd modified to add a newline to the last line (needed for 3.15.1). |

Build notes

- softGlue 1.1+ doesn't always build correctly when make is run with the "-j" option (parallel make). The problem is in base/configure/RULES.Db, which uses the same temporary file name, msi.tmp, for every invocation of msi. Replacing "msi.tmp" with "$\*.tmp" in RULES.Db fixes the problem.
- On my solaris machine, apex2Src/Makefile needed the following lines added: 
    ```    
    # solaris
    apex2DetectorApp_LIBS_solaris += NeXus hdf5_cpp hdf5
    apex2DetectorApp_SYS_LIBS_solaris   += tiff
    apex2DetectorApp_LIBS_solaris   += jpeg sz z
    ```
- On my linux-x86\_64 machine, apex2Src didn't build until I added the following lines to configure/CONFIG: 
    ```
    ifeq (Linux, $(OS_CLASS))
      SHARED_LIBRARIES=NO
    endif
    ```

 Modules named '&lt;name&gt;\_USE' are examples, split off from &lt;name&gt; to remove dependencies that are not needed when the modules are used only to provide support (and not to also implement an example of that support). For modules that do not have an example, see the xxx module.

__areaDetector__

> New module

__asyn__

> Switched from version 4.6 to 4.10

__autosave__

> __4.5__
> 
> - Previously, autosave restored auto\_positions.sav and auto\_settings.sav if no save file had been specified in a call to set\_pass*n*\_restoreFile(). Now, autosave does not restore anything you don't tell it to restore.
> - Can now build with tornado 2.2.2.
> - save\_restore.c:write\_it() was calling open(), fdopen(), fclose(), and close(), in that order, and this worked routinely. However, some doc suggests close() should not be called, and we found a task suspended in the close() call, so the call has been deleted.
> 
> __4.4__
> 
> - If file close fails, retry once. (Previously, would retry up to 100 times.)
> - If file write (including close) fails, retry after save\_restoreRetrySeconds (default value is 60 seconds). Previously, would retry only after the file system was remounted, or the next time the set was triggered.
> - New function save\_restoreSet\_RetrySeconds(int seconds).
> - Don't copy .sav file to .sav&lt;n&gt; (i.e., don't write sequence files) if .sav file write failed.
> - new function save\_restoreSet\_UseStatusPVs(int ok)
> - allow save-file name with more than one embedded '.' character.

__busy__

> __1.2__
> 
> New module

__calc__

> __2.7__
> 
> - Instead of the genSub record, the calc module now uses the aSub record in EPICS base (3.14.10 and higher). Thanks to Eric Norum for detailing the required changes.
> - transform record exports transformRecordDebug, and calcSupport.dbd names it.
> - new .adl files yyArrayCalc\*.adl
> - CalcRecord\*.adl: deleted link-valid fields, which don't exist for calc record.

__camac__

> No changes

__ccd__

> NOTE: This module is __now obsolete__ and has been replaced by the [ areaDetector module.](https://cars.uchicago.edu/software/epics/areaDetector.html/)
> __1.10__
> 
> - Added code to support parallel make.
> - Use new "busy" module for busy record support, not in sscan module any longer.
> - NOTE: The new version of roperServer in R1-9 and R1-10 may not work on some Windows systems. The older server from R1-8 and before can still be used in this case.
>  
> __1.9__
> 
> - Converted roperServer from Visual Basic 6 to Visual Basic .NET 2003.
> - Fixed bug in roperServer that caused it to treat 16-bit data as signed rather than unsigned.

__dac128V__

> No changes

__delaygen__

> New module

__dxp__

> __2.9__
> 
> - Fixed problems with DXP4C2X. It was not correctly downloading FiPPI files when peaking time was changed.
> - Fixed problems with logging errors and warnings on vxWorks. Previously the output from XIA routines was lost after the startup script completed, because vxWorks closes and reopens stdout.
> - Fixed memory leaks in XIA's code on Saturn and DXP4C2X when reading baseline histogram.
> - Added support for parallel make
> - Added "busy" module for busy record, moved from sscan.

__ebrick__

> 

__ip__

> __2.9__
> 
> - pico\_small.adl - use asyn record instead of serial
> - devMPC.c - increased timeout, and defend against timeout; fixed bug when reading volts and return string length &lt; 4

__ip330__

> No changes

__ipUnidig__

> __2.6__
> 
> - drvIpUnidig.c - fixed bug in report function; fixed bug that led to records being processed on every poll until first interrupt.

__love__

> __3.2.4__
> 
> - Corrected a problem when communication would timeout.
> - Modified MEDM screen field colors.
> - Added .req file for save/restore.

__mca__

> No changes

__modbus__

> __1.3__
> 
> - Changed modbusInterpose.c to replace pasynOctet-&gt;writeRaw() and pasynOctet-&gt;readRaw() with pasynOctet-&gt;write() and pasynOctet-&gt;read(), because the raw routines have been removed in asyn R4-10.
> - Changed the driver to use the asynStandardInterfaces interfaces added to asyn in R4-10.

__motor__

> __6.4.3__
> 
>  - Backlash after a new target position
> 
>  A change in R6-4 prevented the motor from doing its' backlash move when a motor move was interrupted by a new target position. The user would see a "tdir" message in the iocsh and the motor would move to the target position minus the backlash distance.
> 
> 
> 
>  - Multiple STOP commands
> 
>  A modification was made to prevent multiple STOP commands from occurring while the motor was decelerating to a stop.
> 
> 
> 
> __6.4.2__
> 
>  - OMS MAXv home switch status
> 
>  Dirk Zimoch (PSI) fixed a bug in the OMS MAXv driver that caused the home switch status in the response string to be overwritten.
> 
> 
> 
>  - asyn motor
> 
>  Matthew Pearson (Diamond) discovered a bug in the Newport XPS asyn motor port drive that was causing idle polling to interfere with setting positions and preventing auto save/restore from working. This fix was copied to the other asyn motor port drives in the motor record distribution; i.e., attocube ANC 150 (drvANC150Asyn.cc) and the motor simulator (drvMotorSim.c).
> 
> 
> 
>  - old device drive architecture
> 
>  A problem was introduced in R6-4 (fixed in R6-4-2) of the old motor record device drive architecture. If during the move of one or more motors the motor task did not issue an OS delay during status updates, it could potentially not respond to any further motor commands.
> 
> 
> 
>   
> __6.4.2__
> 
>  - 64-bit compatiablity
> 
>  Fixed 64 bit compile problems with the PI E816 and Aerotech Ensemble device drivers.
> 
> 
> 
> __6.4.1__
> 
>  - 64-bit compatiablity
> 
>  Fixed 64 bit compile problems with the PI E816 and Aerotech Ensemble device drivers.
> 
> 
> 
> __6.4__
> 
> __Modifications to Existing Features__
> 
>  - Stale SET position data from OMS VME58 controllers.
> 
>  A problem with certain OMS VME58 firmware versions (2.24-8S and all 2.35 versions) has arisen since modifications made under R6-3. When the user sets the motor record's position, the previous target and readback positions are read from the controller on the next update. This occurs with the previous release (R6-3) because the "stale data delay" was changed from 10ms to zero for the drvOms58 driver.
> 
>  With this release the driver searches all VME58 board ID's for either 2.24-8S or any 2.35 version. If any board is found with these versions, the "stale data delay" is set to a non-zero value for all VME58 boards in the system.
> 
>  - "tdir=" error messages
> 
>  A problem was reported by Emma Shepherd (Diamond) with the previous release if the "Use RDBL Link" field (URIP) was set to "Yes". The NTM logic was sending stop commands and issuing the "tdir=.." message to the console if the RDBL link was used. This error was the result of changes to the NTM logic in R6-3.
> 
>  With this release, the NTM logic is restored to using feedback rather than reference positions. In addition, an "NTM deadband factor" field (NTMF) is added to allow the user to set the NTM deadband as follows;
> 
>  NTM deadband = NTMF \* (|BDST| + RDBD)
> 
>  NTMF must be &gt;= 2. If properly configured, the NTM deadband prevents NTM logic from issuing a STOP command at the end of a DC motor move that overshoots its' target position.
> 
>  - Access Security Level changes
> 
>  Major changes have been made to the Access Security Level (ASL) attribute of the motor record fields. With previous releases, the following fields were set to ASL=0; FOF, VOF, SSET, SUSE, VBAS, VMAX, SBAS, SMAX, UREV and MRES. All other fields were set to ASL=1 by default.
> 
>  With this release, the policy is to set all the fields that the user requires to do the following to ASL = 0;
> 
> - move a motor; (VAL, DVAL, RVAL, TWF, TWR, TWV, RLV, JOGF, JOGR)
> - stop a motor; (STOP, SPMG)
> - enable/disable motor torque; (CNEN)
> - set the position of a motor; (SSET, SUSE, SET)
> - set the "user" offset of a motor; (FOF, VOF, FOFF,OFF)
> - update the status of a motor; (STUP)
> - adjust or turn off backlash; (BDST)
>  
>  All other fields are set to ASL = 1.
> 
>  This means that out of the list of fields that were previously set to ASL=0; VBAS, VMAX, SBAS, SMAX, UREV and MRES are now set to ASL=1.
> 
>  - OMS MAXv A24/A32 VMEbus addressing bug fix
> 
>  Previous releases had a problem with the OMS MAXv device driver when it was configured for more than one board, and, either A24 or A32 addressing was specified. The driver was not sizing the address space occupied by each MAXv correctly.
> 
>  - asyn motor archtecture updates
> 
> 18. Motor record GET\_INFO commands were not supported by the asyn motor archtecture in previous releases.
> 19. A motor record bug was fixed that caused unscheduled retries to occur with asyn motor.
>  
> 
> __New Features__
> 
>  - Deferred moves for asyn motors
> 
>  The asyn motor framework now supports a flag to indicate that moves should be deferred. When at zero, moves proceed as normal. When set to one, moves should be deferred and remembered by the controller driver, but not executed immediately. When set back to zero, the controller driver should then start all the moves (or at least moves to the last requested demand positions) that have been deferred, as near to simultaneously as is possible for the particular model of controller. The flag is implemented per-controller, so all axes on a particular controller instance are affected, but axes on other controllers via the same driver are unaffected.
> 
>  It is the responsibility of the motor controller driver to actually provide such functionality, or to give an error if the parameter is not recognised. Currently the Newport XPS controller driver and the Delta Tau PMAC driver (in the tpmac module available from Diamond) support this.
> 
>  To use the flag, connect to any asyn port/addr combination on the controller, using the parameter "DEFER". e.g. for a bo record, use DTYP=asynUInt32Digital, OUT=@asynMask(port,1,1)DEFER, ZNAM="Go", ONAM="Defer"
> 
>  - 64-bit compatiablity
> 
>  Previous releases of the motor record distribution would not compile for 64-bit platforms. Numerous minor modifications were made for this release to attain 64-bit compatibility. Note that at the time of writing (03/14/08), this release was successfully compiled on a Linux Fedora Core 6 x86\_64 host using gcc version 4.1.2, but there are bugs. Since EPICS base (R3.14.9) has not had all the bugs wrung out (Mantis ID's #309, #310), there are no immediate plans to debug 64-bit related problems.
> 
>  - attocube systems AG ANC150 
>  Ron Sluiter added support for the attocube systems AG ANC150 Piezo Step Controller.
> 
>  - Aerotech's Ensemble
>  Chad Weimer (Aerotech) added support for Aerotech's Ensemble family of digital servo controllers.
> 
>  - Physik Instrumente GmbH &amp; Co. Model E-816 
>  John Hammonds added support of the Physik Instrumente (PI) GmbH &amp; Co. E-816 motor controller.

__optics__

> __2.6.1__
> 
> - Added support for a multilayer monochromator
> - XIA\_shutter.db - user command was sometimes overwritten by a poll and dropped

__pilatus__

> __1.6__
> 
> - Notice that this module __will no longer be supported__, users should convert to the [areaDetector](https://cars.uchicago.edu/software/epics/areaDetector.html) module.
> - Use the busy record from the new "busy" module, moved from the sscan module.
> - Support parallel make (make -j).

__quadEM__

> No changes

__sscan__

> __2.6.5__
> 
> - Check all chid's before using them.
> - Modified saveData so that, when it finds the filename it would like to use (e.g., base\_0001.mda) already in use, it writes, e.g., base\_0001\_01.mda, instead of base\_0001.mda\_01, as it used to do.
> 
> __2.6.4__
> 
> - In 2.6.3, saveData crashed under tornado 2.2, because a vxWorks XDR structure changed. Now we define an old and a new structure, and identify the correct structure by its size.
> 
> __2.6.3__
> 
> - scanDetPlot.adl - added count
> - don't build busy record (split out into separate module) but retain a copy here for a while, since the busy module has new different version
> - saveData.c - don't include nfsDrv.h (which is renamed in tornado 2.2.2); instead, define nfsMount, nfsUnmount by hand.
> - sscanRecord.c - handle DBRprecision definition in EPICS 3.14.10; scanOnce() arg cast
> 
> __2.6.2__
> 
> - Removed race conditions affecting callback counters, and added mutex to protect them. Changed timing of when to renew positioner links from now-last\_scan\_start to now-last\_scan\_end.
> - display\_fields.adl uses new link-help displays from std R2.6
> 
> __2.6.1__
> 
> - The sscan record didn't correctly handle reads or writes to PnPA, for n&gt;1. As a result, table scans did not work with positioners 2-4.
> - saveData didn't fail correctly when it could not find the \[basename\] section in its initialization file, and when it failed to connect to the basename PV. Instead, it aborted its initialization, and failed to connect to sscan records.

autosave
--------

Previously, the only way to specify which PV's were to be autosaved was to include PV names in a request file read by create\_xxx\_monitor\_set(). Now, PV's can also be specified in the databases that are loaded into an ioc.

Autosave reports its status to EPICS PV's if it can. If this behavior is not wanted, it can now be turned off with a function call.

Autosave's status database now contains a PV that indicates directly whether or not the save\_restore task is functioning.

The calc engine in EPICS 3.14.9 regards an empty calc expression as an error. When autosave is asked to restore an empty calc expression, it restores the expression '0' instead, which has the same effect but is not treated as an error.

A developer can now specify the file permissions for files that autosave writes. This doesn't work on all operating systems.

After failing to write a .sav file, autosave will now retry after save\_restoreRetrySeconds. Previously, autosave would retry a failed write only when the file system was remounted, otherwise waiting until the next time a save was triggered.

If an error occurs while a .sav file is being written, that .sav file will not be copied to a sequence file.

A save list can now get its file name at run time, from a PV that CA clients can change.

See autosave/documentation/autoSaveRestore.html for more information on these changes.

- - - - - -


calc
----

Previously, the calc module required the modules SSCAN, and GENSUB to build. Now the build adjusts itself to the modules that are available.

The function, len(), was added to array calcs.

Previously, the transform record would continue its operation when any of its input links propagated an error from the linked record. Now, the the user or database developer can choose whether or not to abort processing when this occurs.

A new version of user transforms permits individual transform records to be disabled. (The standard set disables all or none.)

The sCalcout and aCalcout records now honor alarms, and correctly implement the IVOA field. (Thanks to Peter Mueller).

If an sCalcoutRecord link connects to a link field, or if the WAIT field is true, and the sCalcoutRecord's link does not have the attribute, 'CA', the record now complains to the ioc console. (Such a link cannot function as intended, but the record currently cannot fix the problem.)

dxp
---

129. Updated code for DXP4C2X to work again. Based on X10P code from Handel 0.6.47. This makes the DXP4C2X compatible with the Saturn and the xMAP.
130. Changes in Handel code for Saturn to be compatible with Handel version 0.6.47. These are mostly minor. The most important changes are that the Saturn now supports "maxwidth" and "baseline\_threshold" as acquisition parameters, so these are now specified in calibrated units (keV), rather than device units. The dxp record device support (devDxp.c) has been changed to take advantage of this. This change makes the Saturn compatible with the xMAP.
131. Updated documentation to explain how to use udev or hotplug to run the USB Saturn on Linux without root privilege. Added USB\_DEVFS\_PATH environment variable to iocSaturn/st.cmd to fix problem with libusb using /proc/bus/usb when it should be using /dev/bus/usb, and thus not getting permissions right.
132. Fixed problem with EraseAll not displaying the newly erased spectra.
133. This is the first release that builds the xMAP support from source code, rather than from a pre-built DLL from XIA. It uses Handel 0.6.47 from XIA with my modifications to make it work on all supported architectures.
134. Added support for USB 1.0 and USB 2.0 interfaces on Saturn, in addition to existing EPP support. These are supported on the WIN32, Cygwin, and Linux architectures. The following software must be installed on the IOC computer before the USB support will work. 
    - WIN32 and Cygwin: For USB 1.0 Kepler must be installed to provide the required USB driver. For USB 2.0 the PI-SPEC software package from SII must be installed, because it has the required EZ-USB driver. I expect that this driver will be available from XIA soon.
    - Linux. The latest version of the libusb package (0.1.12) must be installed. This can be quickly installed, but requires root priviledge. The IOC application must also currently be run as root, because the USB device is created dynamically and cannot be given non-root access in advance.
135. Changed the default value of MAXWIDTH in the DXP record from 20 to 4, to be legal on xMAP.
136. Removed architecture specific DBD files and Makefile rules, requires asyn R4-9.
137. Enhancements and additions to 4 element detector ADL files.
138. dxp4c2x\_psl.c (CAMAC module). Added support for all of the same parameters that the Saturn (x10p\_psl.c) supports. With this enhancement the DXP2X now has the same EPICS interface as the Saturn.
139. dxpMED.st. Increased number of detectors to 32, bug fixes thanks to Dave Madden from SLS.

ipUnidig
--------

- Now builds for RTEMS and Linux.

Now supports SBS IPOPTOIO8

- - - - - -

love
----


- love/loveApp/src/Makefile

- Removed WIN32 specific code

- love/loveApp/src/loveAppWin32Include.dbd

- No longer needed with asyn R4-9


mca
---

SIS3820 now supported on Linux.

Build option to use LLC sockets to communicate with Canberra AIM module. Currently, this works on vxWorks only.

MCA record forces ACQG=&gt;1 when acquisition is turned on. Without this, a short dwell time resulted in data never being read.

Can read compressed or uncompressed data from Canberra.

- - - - - -

modbus
------

New module.

modbus supports EPICS communication with Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) via the Modbus protocol over TCP, serial RTU, and serial ASCII links. The modbus software provides a layer between standard EPICS asyn device support, and the EPICS asyn TCP/IP or serial port driver.

- - - - - -

optics
------

New support for XIA PF4 filter/shutter

Oxford 4-channel x-ray beam position monitor

New support for an ASRP optical table

- - - - - -

pilatus
-------

New module: an enhanced EPICS interface to the Dectris *Pilatus*pixel-array detector.

- - - - - -

quadEM
------


- quadEM/documentation/quadEMReleaseNotes.html

- Added comments for R2-4

- quadEM/quadEMApp/Db/quadEM\_settings.req

- Changed Average to Read, bug fix

- quadEM/quadEMApp/op/adl/quadEM\_less.adl

- Like quadEM.adl but with fewer controls

- quadEM/quadEMApp/src/drvQuadEM.c

- Removed status argument from interrupt callbacks
- Added status on callbacks for asyn R4-8; remove unused functions


sscan
-----

Removed race conditions affecting callback counters, and added a mutex to protect them. Changed timing of when to renew positioner links from now-last\_scan\_start to now-last\_scan\_end.

display\_fields.adl uses new link-help displays from std R2.6

The base name for files written by saveData can now be selected at run time by the user.

The sscan record can now post array data to clients during a scan. By default, this capability is disabled, because it may confuse existing clients of the sscan record.

If saveData fails to write or update a data file, it can now retry, as controlled by PV's.

Previously, the standard scan and saveData records were combined into a single database, scan.db. Now, the preferred databases to load are standardScans.db (one or more copies), and saveData.db (one copy only).

- - - - - -

std
---

The gpibRecord has been replaced by the asynRecord, which is loaded from the asyn module.

New databases: alarmClock, autoShutter, countDownTimer, ramp\_tweak, scaler16m

The sseqRecord (string Sequence, a variant of the seq record in EPICS base) can now be told to abort the sequence it's executing.

Module release notes
--------------------

- - - - - -

autosave
--------

__4.2.1__


- Added date/time to error messages printed to the console.
- If asVerify is directed to create a restore file, it now writes a trial restore file first, and overwrites the real restore file only if more than half of the PV's were actually connected.
- myPrintErrno modified to print the line and file of caller, and called only if there was an actual error.
- Don't hold epicsMutex for a long time, because any priority inheritance that occurs while the mutex is held will persist until the mutex is released, even if it's no longer needed. Now, the mutex is used to protect a variable which, in turn, protects save\_restore's save-set list.
- Use binary mode for fopen() calls in myFileCopy() (dbrestore.c) to avoid file-size differences resulting from different line terminators on different operating systems. (Thanks to Kay Kasemir for this fix.)

__4.2__


- Added asVerify, a client-side tool to compare autosave .sav files with current PV values. Also can write a .sav file useable for restoring values.

__4.1.3__


- Debug macros made more compliant with various compilers.
- save\_restore made less sensitive to errors. Previously, any file write that set errno would abort the save, but this was just stupid, and caused way more problems than it solved.
- Status PV's were restricted to STRING\_LEN (30) characters, instead of PV\_NAME\_LEN (61).
- Increased stack size to epicsThreadStackBig.
- Don't treat unsupported fsync() as an error.

- - - - - -

calc
----

__2.6.3__


- array calcs reworked to allocate arrays only as needed.   
    aCalcPerform allocates no stack space until it is called. Then, it allocates 20 arrays of length aCalcArraySize (a volatile int, settable from the shell) or the arraySize argument specified by the first caller, whichever is larger.   
    aCalcoutRecord allocates an NELEM-size array for each variable AA-LL, when that variable is first read from or written to.

__2.6.2__


- Added the following functions for the aCalcout record
    
    DERIV take derivative (with respect to element number) FITPOLY fit to 2nd order polynomial FITMPOLY masked fit to 2nd order polynomial NSMOO apply smoothing operator a specified number of times
- reworked medm displays that describe calc expressions
- reworked medm displays for aCalcout record
- fixed swaitRecord docs

__2.6.1__


- sCalcout and aCalcout records were not calling device support's init\_record() routine
- Added FWHM function to array calc support.

__2.6__


- Added array calc support. This generalizes EPICS standard calc support in much the same way that the string calc support did, but with arrays instead of strings.
- Added a python program to test string-calc software.
- Interp support uses different genSub-record fields, and has acquired a mode switch and a success indicator. See calc/documentation/interp.README.
- sCalcout record has two new functions:
    
    
    - TR\_ESC() translates escape sequences into the characters they represent
    - ESC() translates selected unprintable characters into escape sequences.

- - - - - -

camac
-----

__2.5__


- Debug macros changed for compatibility with a wider range of compilers

__2.4__


- Changed drvMotorE500.cc to use generic epicsThread priority

- - - - - -

ccd
---

__1.6__


- Added support for WIN32.
- Removed variable argument macros for debugging in SNL code.
- Minor changes in MAR code.

- - - - - -

dac128V
-------


- No changes.

- - - - - -

dxp
---

__2.5__


- Upgraded xMAP DLLs and firmware to release 0.9.1 of xManager. This release from XIA appears to fix all of the initialization problems and other bugs that I have reported to them.
- Fixed bug in devDxp.c that was causing crashes when reading SCA data on xMAP with 0.9.1 firmware and software.
- Added mutex to interlock access to Handel library. This was needed because the poller thread, asyn port and dxpRecord::init\_record can all be calling Handel at the same time.
- This release uses R6-8 of the mcaRecord, which fixed a serious bug. Previously the MCA record posted monitors for .ACQG=0 (acquire done) before it posted monitors on the VAL field. This could cause clients to collect bad data.
- Added MAXWIDTH and MAXWIDTH\_RBV fields to the dxpRecord.
- Changed the xMAP to use the energy livetime, rather than trigger livetime, for the MCA record livetime.
- Fixed the way in which the software determines what type of hardware (xMAP, Saturn, DXP2X) it is running on. Previously it was reading the HDWRVAR low-level parameter, and this was not a reliable test.
- Moved iocsh commands from drvDxp.c to new file, epicsHandelUtils.c.
- Changed order of downloading parameters in dxpRecord::init\_record so they all get applied the first time.
- Added feature to dxpMED.st. It now copies the ROI LO and HI fields from the MCA records to the corresponding SCA LO and HI fields in the DXP records.
- Implemented the poller thread callbacks in the Saturn database. In R2-4 they were only implemented on the xMAP.
- Loaded EPICS sscan records and initialized saveData in the startup scripts in iocSaturn and iocXMAP. Added menus for them to the top-level medm screens. This is very useful for collecting data as quickly as possible using saveData in the EPICS IOC.
- Combined MCA ROIs and DXP SCAs onto a single medm screen for multi-element detectors.
- Changed the prefix of the PVs in iocXMAP from dxpXMAP:med: to dxpXMAP:.

__2.4__


- Added support for detector "groups" in the dxp and mca record drivers. This is used to turn on and off acquisition on all detectors as efficiently as possible. Modifed dxpMED.db and dxpMED.st to take advantage of this new capability.
- Added support for the new xMAP PXI modules. This support runs on the cygwin-x86 architecture.
- Enhancements to dxpRecord: 
    - Made baseline filter length (BASE\_LEN) be a menu rather than a number.
    - Added readback for baseline filter length (BASE\_LEN\_RBV)
    - Added the baseline cut enable (BASE\_CUT\_ENBL) and readback (BASE\_CUT\_ENBL\_RBV) fields.
    - Implemented the pre-amp gain (PGAIN) and readback (PGAIN\_RBV) fields.
    - Added time/point for the baseline history (BHIST\_TIME). This is currently only implemented on the xMAP.
    - Removed BASETHRADJ since xMAP does not support it, and it's available as low-level parameter.
- Added code to support ADC trace and baseline history to dxpMED.st for multi-element detectors.
- Fixes and enhancements for 40MHz version of Saturn.
- Added support for native Windows build, in addition to Cygwin.
- This version does NOT support the DXP4C2X because that support from XIA lags behind the Saturn and xMAP in terms of what acquisition parameters it supports. The DXP4C2X will be supported in the next release.
- List of things to be added/fixed in next release: 
    - Implement missing functions on DXP-2X so it will work again.
    - Get algorithm for baseline threshold in energy units, implement on Saturn and DXP-2X.
    - Implement ROI mapping mode on Saturn and DXP-2X.
    - Implement MCA mapping mode on xMAP.
    - Implement fast SCA acquisition on all models.
    - Add DXP record fields for polarity, reset interval, and RC time constant.

__2.3__


- Added several readback fields to dxpRecord (BASETHRESH\_RBV, etc.)
- Use value of RUNTASKS from save/restore, so that auto baseline threshold adjust and other bits are restored.
- Fixed bugs in setting SCAs from MCA ROIs which were causing error messages.
- Fixed init\_record in dxpRecord so that BASETHRESH from save/restore is set correctly if automatic baseline threshold adjust is disabled.
- Fixed definition of bit 0 in RUNTASKS in dxp2x\_rc.db and dxp2x\_reset.db. This bug was causing baseline histogramming to stop if any other bits were modified in RUNTASKS.
- Added 40MHz firmware files for the Saturn.
- Fixed bug that was causing bit 0 of RUNTASKS to be reset, turning off baseline histogramming whenever RUNTASKS was modified.
- Added new ECAL field. ADC\_RULE is now at energy=ECAL, not at energy=EMAX/2.

- - - - - -

ip
--

__2.7__


- Added support for Newport LAE500 autocollimator
- Added support for additional thermocouple types for Keithley 2700 multimeter
- Databases using asyn serial support no longer set input/output terminator. This must be done in asyn-record configuration.
- HeidVRZ460\_encoder.db converted to use asyn
- Keithley2kDMM\_mf.db -- Modified by Arun 08-Feb-2006 to include R-type thermocouple
- Keithley2kDMM\_mf20\_settings.req -- new file
- Keithley2kDMM\_mf\_channelN\_settings.req now just includes calcout\_settings.req
- pzt3.db, pzt\_3id.db -- BitBus-based databases deleted.
- Keithley2kDMM.st -- Added support for additional thermocouple types for 2700
- devAiHeidND261.c -- converted to use asyn
- devXxEurotherm.c -- converted to use asyn
- deviceCmdReply.db -- Now is useable for binary data (i.e., strings that may contain unprintable characters, including the null character), and for devices that require CRC's or checksums that are implemented in the string-calc software (in the calc module). However, the string-length limitation is still 39 bytes.
- Added documentation for deviceCmdReply

- - - - - -

ip330
-----

__2.4__


- Minor bug fix in driver.

- - - - - -

ipUnidig
--------

__2.4__


- Ron Sluiter fixed a bug in initIpUnidig() of drvIpUnidig.c. The BSP was not enabling interrupts for whatever level the IP carrier was configured for unless some other IRQ handler, with the same IRQ level, had already enabled interrupts.
- Kurt Goetze added new medm adl files: IpUnidig\_all.adl, IpUnidig\_help.adl, IpUnidig\_top.adl

- - - - - -

love
----

__3.2.3__

minor changes:


- Corrected a problem when communication would timeout.
- Modified MEDM screen field colors.
- Added .req file for save/restore.

__3.2.2__

minor changes:


- Primary MEDM screen.
- Modified startup scripts for Linux.
- Added devLove.dbd which is necessary for other components/applications to have Love Controller support.

__3.2.0__

significant architecture changes


- Module drvLove implements the standard Asyn intefaces asynInt32, asynUInt32Digitial, and asynDrvUser,
- Enhanced MEDM screens for diagnostics,
- Database for monitoring and setting controllers,
- Removed all unused files (i.e. sources, databases, MEDM screens),

__3.1.0__

significant architecture changes


- Added drvLove, multidevice port driver,
- Added ifaceLove, Love-specific interface,
- Added devLove, device support,
- Supports the ai,ao,bi,bo, and mbbi record types, removed support for longin,
- Enhanced MEDM screens for diagnostics,
- Format of INP/OUT field has been modified, refer to database definition files,
- Removed all unused files (i.e. sources, databases, MEDM screens),

- - - - - -

mca
---

__6.9__


- Added support for SIS3820 multi-scaler for both mca and scaler records.
- Added example application (mcaSISTest) for SIS3801 (STR7201) and SIS3820 in SISSrc, and added iocBoot/iocVxWorks/st\_sis.cmd and /mcaApp/op/adl/SISTest.adl to test it.
- Fixed bug with data type of mcaPresetCounts in devMcaAsyn.c
- Fixed bug in mcaRecord.c. Need to force a read of the data when acquisition is turned on. Without it a device that is done acquiring by the time the status is read for the first time will never get the data read (because Read record in database has scanned disabled if not acquiring).

__6.8__


- Minor changes to drvFastSweep and drvIcbAsyn

__6.7__


- Fixed timing bug in communication between record and device support. In previous releases device support was setting the .ACQG field to 0 (Done) before the final read of the device was complete. This meant that channel access clients that were doing cagets() of .ACQG to see when acquisition was complete and then reading data immediately could get incorrect data. Note that this problem did not occur if clients were using monitors (callbacks), because the record did not call dbPostEvents until the final read of data from the device was complete.  The fix to this problem required re-writing the interface between the record and device support so that device support does not directly modify the .ACQG field. Rather it now passes a structure with status information which the record uses to modify the record fields, and it does not set the .ACQG field until the record contains the latest data.
    
        The record support, asyn device support (for all devices except Struck), and the Struck (SIS) device support were all modified.
- mcaRecord 
    - Converted all DBF\_FLOAT record fields to DBF\_DOUBLE.
    - Added the PSTATUS (private) field for status buffer.
    - Removed the ACQP, DWLP, ERTP, ELTP and ACTP (private) fields which are no longer needed because PSTATUS field replaces them.
- Removed macro definitions with variable arguments (e.q. Debug) for portability.

__6.6__


- Added mcaApp/RontecSrc directory with support for the Rontec XFlash MCA. This works with any serial port with asyn support.
- Added support for Canberra AIM on Windows IOCs (using Cygwin).
- Fixed a bug in mcaRecord. If a channel access put should have caused the record to process again because it was busy (.RPRO field=1) it was not processing again because the record only calls recGblFwdLink when acquisition completes. Work around problem by checking RPRO at end of record processing and repeating processing loop if RPRO=1 and acquisition is not complete.
- Fixed occasional timing problem with Canberra AIM on Linux not receiving first inquiry response.
- Fixed problems with the iocLinux and iocVxWorks example IOCs.
- Added iocRontec example IOC.
- Added iocCygwin example IOC for Canberra on Cygwin.
- Added mcaApp/op/adl/mcaTest.adl medm screen for testing the example IOCs.
- Improved the documentation in mcaDoc.html and mcaRecord.html.
- Added the acquiring (.ACQG) field to 16element\_time.adl.
- Things planned for future release: 
    - Add a calibrated X axis PV, so one can plot spectra versus energy in medm
    - Add ROI low and high PVs in calibrated units, so that users can define ROIs in calibrated unit (e.g. energy), and copy ROIs from one MCA to another in these calibrated units.
    - Add medm screen shots to the mcaDoc, mcaCanberra, and mcaStruck html files.

- - - - - -

motor
-----

__5.9.1__


- Some bug fixes?

__6.1__


- Fixed PI C-862 communication errors
- All motorStatus\[xx\].adl displays were modified to show motor position with text rather than with bar graphs.
- New device: Physik Instrumente GmbH &amp; Co. Model E-710

__6.0__


- OMS MAXv Polling Rate allowed to be as high as the system clock
- The New Focus Model 8750 Network Controller device support ("PMNC8750") has been changed to "PMNC87xx". It now supports both the 8750 and 8752 models.
- New devices: Physik Instrumente GmbH &amp; Co. Model C-862, ACS Tech80 SPiiPlus, Spectra-Physics Encoder Mike

- Soft Motor allocation limit  
        Peter Denison (Diamond Light Source) enhanced the Soft Channel device support by eliminating the 50 soft motor limit and replacing it with an unlimited linked list.
- All motors done/stop/moving utility  
        Kevin Peterson's (UNI-CAT) motorUtil task was added to the motor record distribution. The motorUtil task monitors and maintains 3 PV's; $(P)alldone, $(P)allstop, $(P)moving. motorUtil is a replacement for the all\_com\_##.db distributed with the STD support module. See the motorUtil.db file for details.
- Asyn Motor Peter Denison (Diamond), Nick Rees (Diamond) and Mark Rivers (APS) have added a new motor record device support architecture based on ASYN; called "asyn motor" support. The asyn motor support *is an attempt to define a clean, extensible API for motor controller drivers to support*. This is a preliminary release of work in progress. Do not use *asynMotor* device support at this time, except for development and testing purposes only.
- New Focus 8750 Network Controller  
        Joe Sullivan added support for the New Focus Model 8750 Network Controller.
- Physik Instrumente (PI) E-662 piezo controller  
        Joe Sullivan added support for the Physik Instrumente (PI) GmbH &amp; Co. Model E-662 piezo controller.
- Newport XPS-C8 asyn motor support  
        Mark Rivers added asyn motor support for the Newport XPS-C8 motor controller. This is a preliminary release of work in progress. However, it has fewer problems than the previous XPS support, so we recommend using the new asyn support for the XPS, with the understanding that it is still under development.
- Trajectory Scanning  
        Mark Rivers added the Trajectory Scanning software for both the Newport MM4005 and XPS-C8 motor controllers to the motor record distribution.
- OMS PC68 and PC78 support  
        Brian Tieman and Ron Sluiter added support for the standalone, RS-232 versions of the OMS PC68 and PC78 model controllers. The same device driver (OMS PC68/78) supports both models.

__5.8__


- Faulhaber MCDC2805  
        Mark Rivers added support for the Faulhaber MCDC2805 servo controller.
- Parker Hannifin, Compumotor Division, 6K Series  
        Joe Sullivan added support for Parker Hannifin, Compumotor Division, 6K Series controllers.

__5.7__


- Initial Position  
        With this release, if the absolute values of both the save/restore's target position and the controller's commanded position are greater than the re-try deadband (RDBD) at boot-up, then DVAL will be initialized from the controller's value. In other words, if the absolute value of the controller's commanded position is greater than the re-try deadband at boot-up, than the controller's position takes precedence over the save/restore value.
- Physik Instrumente (PI) C-630  
        Kurt Goetze added support for the Physik Instrumente (PI) model C-630 motion controller.
- Physik Instrumente (PI) C-848  
        Support added for the Physik Instrumente (PI) C-848 motor controller.

__2.3__


- Fixed driver so that configuration routines can be called from iocsh.

sscan
-----

__2.5.3__
- Added sscanApp/op/python directory, with the following programs: addMDA.pyFront end for adding MDA files, uses readMDA, opMDA, and writeMDA from mda.py mda.pyPython API for MDA files. Supports reading, writing, and arithmetic operations for up to 4-dimensional MDA files mdaAsc.pyUses mda.py to render a 1-dimensional MDA file as ascii text. opMDA.pyFront end for operating on MDA files, uses readMDA, opMDA, and writeMDA from mda.py
- Fixed problems in the communication between the sscan record and saveData that caused corrupted data files to be written: 
    - The basic problem was that saveData was getting bufferred data arrays, but an unbuffered copy of the sscan record's CPT field. The sscan record now maintains the field BCPT (bufferred CPT) which is posted when data array buffers are switched.
    - A second problem was that saveData was not able to put AWAIT=1 quickly enough to stop a very fast scan in time to ensure integrity of the data file. saveData now writes '1' to the sscan record's AAWAIT field on init, and writes '0' if it ever exits (not a supported operation at this time). As a consequence, AAWAIT no longer occurs in the autosave-request file scan\_settings.req.
    - A remaining problem, thus far seen only on cygwin, is that multidimensional scans can get saveData into trouble because CA monitors sometimes are received by saveData in a different order than they were posted by the sscan records. Currently, neither the sscan record nor saveData defend against this.
- Added Dohn Arms' 'mdautils' software in the sscanApp/src directory. This software can convert an MDA file to ascii, print info about an MDA file, and read an MDA file into C data structures.
- Fixed a race condition in the sscan record that was responsible for hanging scans at the last point (and maybe other things as well).
- the sscan record no longer renews PV links when a scan starts if the new scan follows the previous scan by less than sscanRecordLookupTime.
- If retrace or after-scan fails because recDynLinkPutCallback returns an error, skip the action rather than hang.
- If the sscan record attempts to connect to a PV while an earlier connection attempt is still in progress, it now waits and retries.
- recDynLinkQsize is now exported for use by the ioc shell.
- recDynLink used to crash if one of its callback functions received an event\_handler\_args structure with a status element whose value was not == ECA\_NORMAL. Now it declines to process the event or to pass it on to the client.
- saveData used to check directory permissions by attempting to create a file whose name was illegal (contained ':') on some operating systems.
- rewrote sscanRecord.html

__2.5.2__


- sscanRecord checks parameters more closely, allows before-scan and after-scan links to write to selected PV's of their own sscan record.
- New after-scan action: Move to center of mass of peak (this choice has problems with multiple positioners, since they won't, in general, have the same peak position).
- In previous versions, recDynLink would deadlock if asked to clear the link to a PV while an action for that PV was still on queue. This is fixed.
- saveData zeros unused points in its XDR buffer, because XDR doesn't manage this well.

__2.5.4__


- Changes to scaler record:
    
    
    - PRn and Sn fields are now DBF\_ULONG rather than DBF\_LONG.
    - No longer hardcode VME\_IO device type in the record logic.
    - Removed .CARD record field.
    - Changed interface to device support so that all functions pass precord rather than card, and init\_record passes pointer to device callback structure.
    - Move callback structures from dpvt to rpvt so record does not access dpvt.
- Added asyn device support for scaler record. This is currently used by the SIS3820 device support in mcaApp/SISSrc, but all scaler device support will eventually be changed to use asyn.
- Changed stdApp/Db/scaler\*.db so that $(OUT) is a macro parameter, rather than assuming VME\_IO link type.
- Deleted CARD field from stdApp/op/adl/scaler\*.adl.
- Deleted stdApp/src/femto.dbd, not needed.
- Added timer.db (resettable software timer) and related software: timer.req, timer\*.adl

__2.5.3__


- epid record still had some FLOAT stuff to convert to DOUBLE. Fixed record and docs.
- added userStringSeq10 database, autosave request, and medm display files.
- Added support for the Femto current amplifier ([www.femto.de](http://www.femto.de/)).

__2.5.2__


- sseqRecord.html rewritten. The old version was a minimal modification of seqRecord.html, from the EPICS Record Reference Manual, and was not very clear.
- scaler record: v3.18: Don't post CNT field unless record-support changed its value. Modified debug macro.
- devEpidFast.c: changed strtok\_r to epicsStrtok\_r
- pvHistory: new software to maintain short-term history of a few PV's in the ioc. Software comprises pvHistory.c (genSub routines), devTimeOfDay.c, pvHistory.db, pvHistory.req (autosave-request file), and pvHistory\*.adl, and relies on autosave to save/restore the value arrays.
- softMotor.db: shortened some .DESC field values so they fit.
- all\_com\_4.db: new file
- softMotorConfig.adl: related-display callups were using sCalcout files for calcout records, because synApps did not contain calcout medm displays. Now the calc module does contain calcout displays, so we use them.

- - - - - -

utils
-----


- Modified changePrefix to correctly handle the start\_epics\_xxx script, xxxSupport.dbd, rename iocBoot/iocxxx directory if it exists, and a file named 'run' in iocBoot/\*
- Modified copyAdl so it also finds the medm display files in the asyn module.
